Making a Mirror
====

1. Obtain Android device
----
We had too many. Sad old devices are ideal.
I used a [2012 Nexus 7](http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B009X3UW2G/ref=olp_tab_refurbished?ie=UTF8&condition=refurbished&qid=1441327955&sr=8-1).

2. Obtain 2-way mirror
---
We did this the old-fashioned way, and quested to [Canal Plastic Center](http://canalplastic.com/). A beautiful and highly recommended establishment.

I can't vouch for them, but there are also two-way mirror acrylic sheets [on the internet](http://www.tapplastics.com/product/plastics/cut_to_size_plastic/two_way_mirrored_acrylic/558).

Get a mirror at least as large as your Android device.

3. Sticky stuff for mounting
---
Our trickiest problem was figuring out how to mount everything with minimal damage and error.
We eventually discovered [reusuable double-sided adhesive](http://www.amazon.com/Command-Assorted-8-Small-4-Medium-4-Large/dp/B0084M68IO/ref=pd_sim_sbs_229_6?ie=UTF8&refRID=1TX12CR5RF0RTP6CKJR7&dpSrc=sims&dpST=_AC_UL320_SR202%2C320_), which is amazing. 

We're using it both to mount the mirror to the device, and the device to the wall.
